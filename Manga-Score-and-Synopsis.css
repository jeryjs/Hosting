Dedicated Huntsmen and Huntresses battle Grimm with both customized weapons and their own Semblances, unique abilities derived from the energy of one's soul. Some warriors also utilize a crystallized energy propellant, Dust, to bestow their weapons with elemental properties. In this dangerous line of work, rigorous training is required to stay alive. To that end, each of Remnant's four Kingdoms have established schools to properly groom children holding aspirations of becoming licensed Huntsmen.\a \a At Beacon Academy in the Kingdom of Vale, a promising group of future Huntresses make their debut as Team RWBY. Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long each come from different backgrounds and often butt heads as a result. However, when they cooperate, they are a formidable force who have even attracted the attention of Beacon's headmaster Professor Ozpin. Alongside fellow students such as those in Team JNPR, the young prodigy Ruby and her friends engage in adventures that pit them against an extremist Faunus group known as the White Fang. Every explosive encounter also brings them closer to the true villains orchestrating conflicts from the shadows.\a \a [Written by MAL Rewrite]"; background-image: url(https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/196046.webp); background-size: cover; background-blend-mode: overlay; background-position: center center; }

Title : Tower of God \a \a Twenty-Fifth Bam had been alone his whole life until he met Rachel. Now, however, Rachel is set on climbing the Tower, and she is willing to leave Bam behind to do so. After Rachel disappears in a veil of light, Bam follows her, vowing to ascend the Tower in hopes of meeting her again.\a \a But the Tower is a dangerous place full of ancient secrets, fearsome monsters, and nefarious humans. Each floor is protected by an Administrator who puts the daring challengers through grueling tests that will push them to their limits.\a \a As he confronts Headon, the Administrator of the first floor, Bam learns that he is an ''Irregular,'' someone who was not chosen by the Tower but was able to enter it on his own, an extremely rare event inside the Tower. Regardless of this revelation, however, his path forward is clear. Be it wealth, power, glory, or even reuniting with Rachel, all desires will be realized at the top of the Tower.\a \a [Written by MAL Rewrite]"; background-image: url(https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/223694.webp); background-size: cover; background-blend-mode: overlay; background-position: center center; }

Thanks to the legendary hero Shion Bladearts, wielder of Excalibur, and his loyal band of companions, the Gate was sealed off and the demonic threat was vanquished.\a \a Unfortunately, the seal was incomplete and has begun to weaken, allowing the demons to once again begin their attack.
