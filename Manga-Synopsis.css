People who stray from their soul's fate, whether it be through an unfortunate accident or an unplanned murder, leave behind a shattered \"psycholith\"—a rock that is a manifestation of their soul. When these are left behind, they stain the environment, ultimately creating \"negative points\"—places that interfere with a soul's plan, causing a vicious cycle of misfortune.\a \a The righteous Sakurai and apathetic Amano are a pair of specialists tasked with ensuring that souls follow their natural paths. To that end, as part of Psycholith Collection & Cleaning, they collect and dispose of shattered psycholiths and clean up stains. But there is another side to their job, one with moral ambiguity. They must also prevent psycholiths from shattering—even if that entails killing the soul's host.\a \a [Written by MAL Rewrite]"; }

But both Kanon and Shannon's love will be put to the test when the rest of the Ushiromiya family arrives for the annual family conference, and Beatrice enacts a competition for them to find Kinzou's hidden gold. Whoever finds the precious ingots will gain the coveted position of family head, and everyone has their eyes on the prize. But what starts off as a bizarre game soon turns into pure terror, and some of them may not make it out alive. Will the two servants be able to protect the ones they love?\a \a [Written by MAL Rewrite]"; }
